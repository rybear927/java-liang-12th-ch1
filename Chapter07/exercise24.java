//(Simulation: coupon collectorâ€™s problem) Coupon collector is a classic statistics
//problem with many practical applications. The problem is to repeatedly pick
//objects from a set of objects and find out how many picks are needed for all the
//objects to be picked at least once. A variation of the problem is to pick cards from
//a shuffled deck of 52 cards repeatedly, and find out how many picks are needed
//before you see one of each suit. Assume a picked card is placed back in the deck
//before picking another. Write a program to simulate the number of picks needed
//to get four cards from each suit and display the four cards picked (it is possible a
//card may be picked twice). Here is a sample run of the program:
//Queen of Spades
//5 of Clubs
//Queen of Hearts
//4 of Diamonds
//Number of picks: 12
