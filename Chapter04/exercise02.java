//(Geometry: great circle distance) The great circle distance is the distance between
//two points on the surface of a sphere. Let (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) be the
//geographical
//latitude and longitude of two points. The great circle distance between
//the two points can be computed using the following formula:
//d = radius * arccos(sin (x1) * sin(x2) + cos(x1) * cos(x2) * cos(y1 - y2))
//Write a program that prompts the user to enter the latitude and longitude of two
//points on the earth in degrees and displays its great circle distance. The average
//radius of the earth is 6,371.01 km. Note you need to convert the degrees into
//radians
//using the Math.toRadians method since the Java trigonometric methods
//use radians. The latitude and longitude degrees in the formula are for north
//and west. Use negative to indicate south and east degrees. Here is a sample run:
//VideoNote
//Compute great circle distance
//Enter point 1 (latitude and longitude) in degrees: 39.55 âˆ’116.25
//Enter point 2 (latitude and longitude) in degrees: 41.5 87.37
//The distance between the two points is 10691.79183231593 km
