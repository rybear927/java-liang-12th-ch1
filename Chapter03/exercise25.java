//(Geometry: intersecting point) Two points on line 1 are given as (x1, y1) and
//(x2, y2) and on line 2 as (x3, y3) and (x4, y4), as shown in Figure 3.8a and b.
//The intersecting point of the two lines can be found by solving the following
//linear equations:
//(y1 - y2)x - (x1 - x2)y = (y1 - y2)x1 - (x1 - x2)y1
//(y3 - y4)x - (x3 - x4)y = (y3 - y4)x3 - (x3 - x4)y3
//This linear equation can be solved using Cramerâ€™s rule (see Programming
//Exercise 3.3). If the equation has no solutions, the two lines are parallel (see
//138 Chapter 3 Selections
//Figure 3.8c). Write a program that prompts the user to enter four points and displays
//the intersecting point. Here are sample runs:
